# Smart Minutes

Smart Minutes Contract aims to decentralize the meeting minutes to store it as a
non-fungible token, NFT.

Smart Minutes UI aims to view the details of the meeting minute once it gets
added to the chain.

It is an effort from **Youth Council of Chhyorten Tashi Tamang Gumba** to
digitize buddhist monasteries to motivate and include youths with their
expertise.

This repository contains the source code of the smart contract and UI that is used to
add gumba meeting minutes as an NFT.
